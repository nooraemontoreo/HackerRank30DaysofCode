#Task11
# Today, we're building on our knowledge of Arrays by adding another dimension. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and
# an instructional video!

# Context 
# Given a 6 x 6 2D Array, A:

# 1 1 1 0 0 0
# 0 1 0 0 0 0
# 1 1 1 0 0 0
# 0 0 0 0 0 0
# 0 0 0 0 0 0
# 0 0 0 0 0 0
# We define an hourglass in A to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in A's graphical representation:

# a b c
#   d
# e f g
# There are 16 hourglasses in A, and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values.

# Task 
# Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in A, then print the maximum hourglass sum.

# Input Format
# There are 6 lines of input, where each line contains 6 space-separated integers describing 2D Array A; every value in A will be in the
# inclusive range of -9 to 9.

# Constraints
# -9 <= A[i][j] <= 9
# 0 <= i,j <= 5

# Output Format
# Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in A.

#Task 12 inheritance

You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Studentinherits all the properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:

    A Student class constructor, which has  parameters:
        A string, .
        A string, .
        An integer, .
        An integer array (or vector) of test scores, .
    A char calculate() method that calculates a Student objectâ€™s average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:

Sample Input
Heraldo Memelli 8135627

100 80
	
Heraldo Memelli 8135627

Sample Output
Name: Memelli, Heraldo
ID: 8135627
Grade: O
